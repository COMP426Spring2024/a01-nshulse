    <p class="content"> Daedalus, the skilled inventor, and his son, Icarus, find themselves trapped inside the labrynth. Daedalus quickly begins to
        think about how they can escape. Daedalus observes birds flying in the sky and gets the idea of making wings. Using bird feathers and beeswax, Daedalus
        constructs 2 pairs of wings for himself and Icarus. By flapping the wings like a bird, they will be able to escape the labrynth.
    </p>

    <p class="content"> There is one problem, however, the wings are very fragile. With limited resources, Daedalus was not able to construct perfect wings.
        If they flew too close to the sun, the beeswax would melt and the wings would fall apart. And if they flew too close to the ocean, the moisture would
        weigh down the feathers and they would fall. Daedalus emphasized to Icarus how important it was to stay in the sweetspot between the sun and the ocean.
        Daedalus would fly first and all Icarus would have to do is fly closely behind Daedalus, making sure to follow his path.
    </p>

    <p class="content"> Soon it was time to attempt the escape. Daedalus took flight and the wings worked perfectly! Icarus followed close behind and was overwhelmed
        with joy. Icarus flew closer and closer to the sun, despite warnings from Daedalus. Eventually, Icarus got so close to the sun that the beeswax on his wings meleted.
        Icarus' wings fell apart and he fell into the ocean and drowned.
