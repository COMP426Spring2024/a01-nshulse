      <p class="content"> Daedalus was well known in Athens for being a great inventor. During his time in Athens, he taught his newphew Talos everything that he knew.
        Daedalus soon realized that Talos was smarter than him. He grew jealousy and hatred for Talos that led to Daedalus throwing Talos off a cliff. Daedalus was banished
        from Athens.
      </p>

      <p class="content"> After being banished, Daedalus was able to seek refuge in Crete thanks to King Minos. In Crete Daedalus had a son, Icarus. Daedalus would invent and build things for Minos, like
        a labrynth to imprison a Minotaur. Minos suspected that Daedalus had helped a hero to defeat the Minotaur, and Minos imprisoned Daedalus and Icarus inside the labrynth.
